# react-spring-tut

    A simple tutorial for react-spring library , a library to animate React and React-Native

## Motivation

    Most of react-spring tutorials and examples are using multi/complex configuration which not explaining the bare use of every single
    hook, this tutorial made to give a very basic introduction of how these hooks works and if you want to dig more you can then go and explore
     library examples, it could be a bit confusing but you will be able to decode them easily after getting through this tutorial.

## How to use it ?

    Just download it
        $ git clone https://github.com/majidzeno/react-spring-tut.git```
    and run
        $ npm i
        $ npm start

    then you're good to go.
    In every hook example there are 2 files ,
    "start" : where you try to solve the case, and if you get stuck go to "end" file you will find the solution.
